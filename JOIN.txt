SELECT EMPLOYEE.*,COMPENSATION.Salary,COMPENSATION.Bonus
FROM EMPLOYEE, COMPENSATION
WHERE EMPLOYEE.EmpID = COMPENSATION.Employ ;

You can cut down on the amount of typing by using aliases (or correlation names).
An alias is a short name that stands for a table name. If you use aliases in recasting
the preceding query, it comes out like this:

SELECT E.*, C.Salary, C.Bonus
FROM EMPLOYEE E, COMPENSATION C
WHERE E.EmpID = C.Employ ;

In this example, E is the alias for EMPLOYEE, and C is the alias for COMPENSATION. The alias is local to the statement it’s in. After you declare an alias (in the
FROM clause), you must use it throughout the statement. You can’t use both the
alias and the long form of the table name in the same statement.
